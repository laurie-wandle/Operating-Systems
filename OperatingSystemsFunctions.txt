The MacOS is a user friendly operating system.  Not only is it pleasing to use, but also pleasing to look at. 
I feel much more organized when using MacOS on my desktop.

I feel the same way when I use Apple iOS on my iPhone 6s.  Not only is the interface easy to look at, so is the phone itself...with it's Rose Gold metallic shine.  I enjoy taking photos with this operating system but I really hope they fix the new software update and go back to a similar interface like the previous one. 

I do miss using Google Android because of all the extra applications it had.  I have to admit, my Android phone was a lot more entertaining to use, but the Apple iOS has a lot less glitches and I think it was worth the switch.
